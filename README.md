# Flight_Fare_Prediction
This dataset contains the information about the various flghts and their prices according to their source and destination.
The dataset also describes how the prices varies by the total stops to reach the destination, The dataset contains 10682 rows and 11 columns.
 Here we have to predict the price of a flight based on the source and destination and total stops
Performed feature engineering on data having 11
columns and 10682 rows using Numpy, Pandas,
Seaborn, Matplotlib
Hyperparameter tuning is done by Randomised
search cv.
Built And Traiined the model using Random Forest
Regression,evaulated the model usimg distplot by
comparing the skewness of the data and also
evaluated using the scatter plot.
Analysed the model predIiction using RMSE, MSE, and MAE
